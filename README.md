PROJECT FINANCE
 


 
	Question 1: While preparing a financial model what are the assumptions we need to take. Please list down the list of assumptions with the values, assuming the project will be set up in India.

The details of the project are given as follows 
PROJECT DETAILS
Size in Sq. Ft	3000	10.35
Equity	30%	3.11
Debt	70%	7.25
Debt Service Reserve (DSR)	0.25 yrs.	 

In the project details table, 
	The rule of Equity + Debt = 1 is always applicable.
	The total cost of the project in millions of Rupees is 10.35
	The equity value of the total cost of the project in millions is 3.11 {=(30/100)10.35}
	Likewise, debt value of the total cost of the project in millions is 7.25 {=(70/100)10.35}

ASSUMPTIONS
Inflation	7.00%	Debt rate	10.0%	USD/INR	70.00
DDT	0.00%	Moratorium	0.25 yrs.	Discount	10%
Tax Holiday	0 yrs.	Debt tenure	10.0 yrs.	Construction	0.25 yrs.
Tax rate	25.00%	Depreciation	7.00%	MAT	18.5%

In the table, we can see that the details of the assumption are specified.
It is always essential to assume the financial parameters of the project based on the past performance of any project to create a financial model that estimates the profitability of the project.
	The rate of inflation and depreciation is assumed to be fixed by 7% for estimating the operating expenses and assets for the following term period.
	There is no Division Distribution Tax is avail because there is no dividend to be paid as a tax by the investors which is exempted.
	Usually, tax holidays are available to reduce Sales tax, there is no tax holiday is provided.
	The tax rate is assumed to be 25% for the project.
	The Debt rate is assumed to be 10% for the project until 40 repayment periods. 
	The Exchange rate for the currency is assumed to be Rs.70 per USD for a decade.
	Construction is for a quarter in a year i.e. COD period from today.
	The Discount of 10% remains constant for the upcoming decade.
	Moratorium period is when a particular period is exempted to repay the debt i.e. June 2020 period in debt sheet.
	Since the debt repayment is for 40 periods and then it is repaid in every quarter so the debt tenure is 10 years.
	Minimum Alternative Tax is 18.5% which is provided to the Government to facilitate the company which provides zero-tax to pay the MAT. Since we already assumed the tax rate is 25% so the project does not require MAT.
	In the cost, revenue and debt sheet some parameters are assumed like the rates of the expenses which are fixed, average occupancy, rent appreciation, deposit, rent per month, interest on the rental deposit.
Question 2. Explain the functions of cost, Revenue and Debt sheet of a financial model?
 COST FUNCTION
Project Cost	 	 	 
 	Rate (Rs./sq.ft)	3000	% of Project Cost
Flat	2500	           75,00,000 	72.5%
Interior Decoration	125	            3,75,000 	3.6%
Furniture	250	            7,50,000 	7.2%
Fixtures	10	               30,000 	0.3%
Building Registration	10	               30,000 	0.3%
 	 	 	 
Broker Fee	75	            2,25,000 	2.2%
Stamp Duty	250	            7,50,000 	7.2%
Fund Raising Fee	25	               75,000 	0.7%
Transfer of Deed Fee	50	            1,50,000 	1.4%
 	 	 	 
Interest During Moratorium	120	            3,60,000 	3.5%
Loan and Documentation Fee	25	               75,000 	0.7%
 	 	 	 
CSR, HSE, Training	10	               30,000 	0.3%
 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 
Total Project Cost	 	        1,03,50,000 	 

	In the above Cost table, we notice there are 12 different types of expenses are mentioned in the 1st Column. 
	There is a rate that is allocated for each type of cost per square feet (mentioned in 2nd column in blue). 
	The following are the cost of 3000 sq. feet of the expenses which are mentioned in the 3rd Column.
	Flat = (2500×3000) = 7500000
	Interior Decoration = (125×3000) = 375000
	Furniture = (250×3000) = 750000
	Fixtures = (10×3000) = 30000
	Building Registration = (10×3000) = 30000
	Broker Fee = (75×3000) = 225000
	Stamp Duty = (250×3000) = 750000
	Fund Raising Fee = (25×3000) = 75000
	Transfer of Deed Fee = (50×3000) = 150000
	Interest during Moratorium = (120×3000) = 360000
	Loan and documentation fee =   (25×3000) = 75000
	CSR, HSE, Training =  (10×3000) = 30000
Total Project Cost = (sum of all the costs in the 3rd column) = 10350000
	Percent of the cost column (4th Column) refers to the percentage it contributes to the Total Project Cost
For Example, Flat = (7500000/10350000×100) = 72.46%
Likewise, it follows for all the costs.
Monthly Costs
O & M Cost (Monthly Breakdown)	 	 3000	 
Building Maintenance	15	               45,000 	 
Utilities (Electric + Water + Internet)	4	               12,000 	 
Salary (Maid + Accountant)	4	               12,000 	 
Plumber + Electrician + Misc. etc.	3	                 9,000 	 
Insurance (0.35 %)	10	               30,000 	 
 	 	 	 
Total O&M Cost (per year)	 	            9,66,000 	 

	In the above Cost table, each type of expense is on every month (except Insurance which is yearly basis) whereas the earlier cost table is yearly. 
	The 2nd Column is the cost of expenses per square feet.
	The third column refers to the costs of the expenses for the size 3000 square feet the following are the costs mentioned
Building Maintenance = (15×3000) = 45000
Utilities = (4×3000) = 12000
Salary = (4×3000) = 12000
Plumber + Electrician + Miscellaneous etc. = (3×3000) = 9000
Insurance = (10×3000) = 30000
 Total O&M Cost (per year) = {[(45000+12000+12000+9000)×12]+30000} = 966000
REVENUE FUNCTION
Revenue Parameters	 	 	 	 
City	Mumbai	 	 	 
Size (Sq. feet)	      3,000.00 	 	 	 
Avg. Occupancy (Months)	          10.00 	 	 	 
Rent (Rupees./Month)	 2,50,000.00 	 	 	 
Deposit (Months)	            4.00 	(OR One-Third of Annual Rent)
Rent Appreciation	5%	 	 	 
Interest on Rental Deposit	8%	 	 	 

The Revenue parameters are assumed to estimate the revenues that will be earned in the future period.
Revenue Calculation for a year 
Year--->	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
Rent (Million INR)	2.500	2.625	2.756	2.894	3.039	3.191	3.350
Interest on Deposit 	0.067	0.070	0.074	0.077	0.081	0.085	0.089
Revenue (million INR)	2.567	2.695	2.830	2.971	3.120	3.276	3.440

Note: There are 25 periods of revenue to be estimated and only the first 7 periods are mentioned here for knowledge purpose.
In the above table, the first row refers to the period in a year which begins in 2021 as the first period. 
We notice that Rent for the year (in the 2nd Row) = (Rent × Average Occupancy) = (250000 × 10) = 2.5 Million in the 1st period
In the case of the 2nd period,   we calculate the rent for the year (2nd period) = [(rent of the previous year)×(1+Rent Appreciation)] = 2.5(1+0.05) = 2.625 Million
Likewise, we calculate the 3rd period to the 25th period using the formula mentioned above.
The following is the way to calculate Interest on Deposit,
Interest on deposit for period 1 = [Rent of 1st period ×Interest on Rental Deposit×Deposit] = ((2.5×8×4)/(12×100)) = 0.06667
Which is similar to PNR of Simple Interest formula.
Likewise, we calculate it for periods 2 to 25.
Revenue for the 1st period = (Rent for  1st period+Interest on deposit for 1st period) = (2.5 + 0.0667) = 2.567
Similarly, we calculate for the other periods.
DEBT FUNCTION
Debt Amount	7.25
Debt rate	10.00%
Moratorium	0.25 years
Term	10.0 years
Payment Periods	40
One period is one quarter
COD	6-Jun-2020
First Quarter End	4-Sep-2020

The debt parameters are assumed as above.

10	24-Nov-2022	0.15438	0.13424	0.28861	6.04577
Note: There are 40 periods in the debt schedule

	We can Calculate Interest payment and the principal amount of payment using the debt rate, repayment periods and debt amount and the total period.
	In period 0, the interest payment = 0.18113 whereas the principal amount of payment is 0 because the interest payment is paid in the moratorium period so there is no principal amount of payment in that payment period.
	In period 1, the interest payment = 0.18113 and the principal amount of payment = 0.10749.
	Similarly, until the period 40 is calculated
	To calculate, Total payment  = (Interest payment of the period+Prinicipal amount of payment of the period) 
	In period 0, Total payment = (0.18113 + 0) = 0.18113
	In period 1. Total payment = (0.18113 + 0.10749) = 0.28861
	Calculate until 40th period.
	To calculate, Principal Balance = (Previous period principal balance-Current period Principal amount payment)
	In the period 0, Principal balance = (7.25 – 0) = 7.25 (i.e., the initial debt rate is the previous principal balance - there is no principal amount in the period 0 because it is the moratorium period)
	In the period 1, Principal balance = (7.25 – 0.10749) = 7.14251
	Similarly, we could calculate until the last period.
Debt Schedule for a year
Date (EoQ)	Int. Pmt.	Prin. Pmt.	Total Pmt.
30-Jun-2021	0.708	0.45	1.154
30-Jun-2022	0.662	0.49	1.154
30-Jun-2023	0.611	0.54	1.154
29-Jun-2024	0.554	0.60	1.154
29-Jun-2025	0.492	0.66	1.154
29-Jun-2026	0.423	0.73	1.154
29-Jun-2027	0.347	0.81	1.154
28-Jun-2028	0.263	0.89	1.154
28-Jun-2029	0.171	0.98	1.154
28-Jun-2030	0.069	1.09	1.154
Total	4.300	7.25	11.545

	The above table is the interest payment and print payment and total payment for a year.
Since the payment period is for 40 terms i.e., quarters in a year, so the debt is repaid in 10 years from 2020 to 2030.
	Calculating Interest payment for the year,
	The Interest payment for the year 2021 = (Sum of the interest payment from period 1 to 4) = (0.18113+0.17844+0.17568+0.17286) = 0.708
	The Interest payment for the year 2022 = (Sum of the interest payment from period 5 to 8).
	Similarly, we calculate until the end period.
	Calculating Principal amount of payment for the year,
	The Principal amount payment for the year 2021 = (Sum of the principal amount of payment from period 1 to 4) = (0.10749+0.11018+0.11293+0.11575) = 0.446
	The Principal amount payment for the year 2022 = (Sum of the principal amount of payment from period 5 to 8)
	Similarly, we calculate until 2030.
	Calculating Total payment,
Total payment  = (Interest payment for the year+Principal amount of payment for the year)
	Total payment for the year 2021 = (0.708+0.446) = 1.154
	Likewise, we calculate the balance total payment for the following years.

	Question 3. Explain in detail the various steps involved (with the importance) in the fin flows sheet. Why and what the bank needs to check before financing the project.

Note: There are 25 periods of financial cash flows that are to be estimated since knowing how to calculate for 2 periods is enough to calculate the rest of the period.
	We notice that Rent for the year  = (Rent × Average Occupancy) = (250000 × 10) = 2.5 Million in the 1st period
In the case of the 2nd period,   we calculate the rent for the year  = [(rent of the previous year)×(1+Rent Appreciation)] = 2.5(1+0.05) = 2.625 Million
	Interest on deposit for period 1 = [Rent of 1st period ×Interest on Rental Deposit×Deposit] = ((2.5×8×4)/(12×100)) = 0.06667
                  Interest on deposit for period 2 = [Rent of 2nd period ×Interest on Rental Deposit×Deposit] = ((2.625×8×4)/(12×100)) = 0.070
	Total Revenue for the 1st period = (Rent for  1st period+Interest on deposit for 1st period) = (2.5 + 0.0667) = 2.567
Similarly, we calculate for the period 2 and other periods.

	Building Maintenance for the 1st period = (15×3000×12) = 0.540 in Million Rs.
Building Maintenance for the 2nd  period = (Building Maintenance for the previous period×(1+Inflation rate)) = [0.540×(1+0.07)] = 0.578 in Million Rs.

	Utilities for the 1st period = (4×3000×12) = 0.144 in Million Rs.
Utilities for the 2nd period = (utilities for the previous period(1+inflation)) = [0.144 × (1+0.07)] = 0.154 in Million Rs. 

	Salaries for the 1st period =  (4×3000×12) = 0.144 in Million Rs.
Salaries for the 2nd period = (Salaries for the previous period×(1+inflation)) = [0.144 × (1+0.07)] = 0.154 in Million Rs. 

	Plumber + Electrician + Miscellaneous etc. for the 1st period = (3×3000×12) = 0.108  in Million  Rs.
Plumber + Electrician + Miscellaneous etc. for the 2nd  period = (Plumber+Electrician+Misc.etc.for the previous period×(1+inflation)) = 0.116  in Million  Rs.

	Insurance for the 1st period  = (10×3000) = 30000 Rs.
Insurance for the 2nd period  = (Insurance for the previous period×(1+inflation)) = (30000×(1+0.07)) = 32,100 Rs.

	Total operating Expenses for period 1 = (0.540+0.144+0.144+0.108+0.030) = 0.966 in Million Rs.
Similarly, we calculate for period 2 and other periods.

	EBITDA for the period = (Total Revenue – Total Operating Expenses)
EBITDA for period 1 = (2.567 – 0.966) = 1.601 in Million Rs.

	The Interest payment for period 1 = -(Sum of the interest payment from period 1 to 4) = -(0.18113+0.17844+0.17568+0.17286) = -0.708 Million Rs.
The Interest payment for period 2 = -(Sum of the interest payment from period 5 to 8) = -0.662 million Rs.

	Depreciation for period 1 = -(Flat of 3000 sq. feet × Depreciation rate) = -0.525 Million Rs. 
Depreciation for period 2 = -(Depreciation for period 1-(Depreciation for period 1×Depreciation rate)) = -(0.525 – (0.525 × 0.07)) = -0.488 Million Rs.

	Total Non-Operating Expenses for a period = - (Interest payment for that period × Depreciation for that period) 
Total Non-Operating Expenses for period 1 = -(0.708 + 0.525) = -1.233 Million Rs.
Similarly, we calculate for the other following periods.

	Income before Tax = (EBITDA + Total Non-Operating Expenses)
Income before Tax for period 1 = (1.601 – 1.233) = 0.368 Million Rs. 

	Tax = - (Tax rate × Income before Tax) 
Tax for period 1 = -(0.368 × 0.25) =- 0.092 Million Rs.

	Net Income = (Income before Tax + Tax)
Net Income for period 1 = (0.368 + 0.092) = 0.276 Million Rs.

	Equity = -3.11 Million Rs. for only today and exempted from other periods.

	Add back Depreciation = (- of depreciation) since depreciation is already (in –ve) so Add Back Depreciation is positive.

	Principal amount payment for period 1 = -(Sum of the principal amount of payment from period 1 to 4 in debt schedule) = -(0.10749+0.11018+0.11293+0.11575) = -0.446
Principal amount period for period2 = -(Sum of the principal amount of payment from period 5 to 8 in debt schedule)

	CSR (50% of Net Income) = - [(Add back Depreciation + Net Income) ×0.5]
       CSR for period 1 = -(0.525+0.276) × 0.5 = -0.004
Note: For Interest payment, Depreciation, Total Non-Operating Expenses, Tax, Equity, Principal payment we denote it Negatively.
	Final Project Cash flow(equity) = Sum of all possible cash flows = -3.11 Million Rs. for today

	Final Project Cash flow = Sum of the cash flows = -10.35 Million Rs. for today

Note: from period 1 until the last period, the Final Project Cash flow = Final Equity Cash flow
	IRR = 0.693 which implies that at 6.93% of interest rate cause Net Present Value to be 0.
	DSCR = - (Net Income+Add Back Depreciation-CSR-Interest Payment-Principal Payment)/(Interest Payment+Principal payment)
This formula is applied only if Interest payment ≠0
Conclusion:
DSCR for period 1 = 1.70
Debt Service Coverage Ratio needs to be > 1 to obtain debt as it means that the project may able to repay the debt.
 When the project is funded only by equity, then project IRR = Equity IRR. 
In case, the project is only funded by the debt, equity IRR simply does not exist.
For periods 3 to last period can be calculated using the related formula used for periods 1 and 2.
RESULTS
Equity IRR	20.00%
Min DSCR	1.70
Average DSCR	2.04
Project IRR	8.43%
	
The above-given table of details is assumed. The Result table is estimated by the financial cash flows table. In the Result Table,

Equity IRR > Project IRR which indicates that the project is profitable. This also indicates that the project is funded by both debt and equity.

Minimum DSCR is 1.70 which is from period 1 i.e., from 2021 and the average DSCR is 2.04.
It refers that project cash flows the ability to repay the debt.

Banks need to check Past Years Financial Statements, Memorandum of Agreement, Articles of Agreement, Business Bank Statement, Current Debt Statement from other banks, Project Cash Flow Report, Project Feasibility Report, Project Agreements, Income Source and Project Asset Details, Company and Management Profile to find that whether the company could able to repay the debt-financed by Bank.
